<b><big>Women's empowerment</big> may be defined in several ways, including accepting women's viewpoints or making an effort to seek them, 
raising the status of women through <u>education</u>, awareness, <u>literacy</u>, and training.
Women's empowerment equips and allows women to make 
<u>life-determining </u>decisions through the different problems in society.
They may have the opportunity to redefine <u>gender roles </u>or other such roles, 
which in turn may allow them more freedom to pursue desired <big>goals</big>.</b>

<i>Women's empowerment</i> has become a significant topic of discussion in development and economics.
<i><u>Economic empowerment</u></i> allows women to control and benefit from <big>resources, assets, and income</big>. 
It also aids the ability to manage risk and improve women's well-being. It can result in approaches to support <b>trivialized genders</b> 
in a particular <big>political or social context</big>. While often interchangeably used, the more comprehensive concept of <b>gender empowerment</b>
concerns people of any gender, stressing the distinction between <i>biological</i> and <i>gender</i> as a role.
Women empowerment helps in <i>boosting</i> the status of women through <i>literacy, education, training</i> and awareness creation.
Furthermore, women's empowerment refers to women's ability to make <u>strategic life</u> choices which had been previously denied them.
